# Super Secret Code - Libraries

Decoupled PHP libraries.

> _Note_: `ssc/lib` is a **monorepo**, it is not possible to install it in your projects.
> It contains the code for multiple packages, this is where the changes for these are done.
> Each package can be installed, individually, in your projects (eg `composer require ssc/<sub-package>`).
